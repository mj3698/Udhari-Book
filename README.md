# udharibook

A new Flutter application.

In the day to day life we do various transactions like giving loan to some one or it can be borrowing the money from others.
And its very difficult to remember the transactions we made at the month end.
The Udhari Book is an application in which the user can maintain the transactions by entering the money given or borrowed from some one.
This cross platform application provides a common screen between the borrower and the giver, so that both of them have an account of the transactions they had.
The user can also generate the statement of the particular period.
All the data are stored at Google realtime database with 100% secured.

**This app is under development.**
